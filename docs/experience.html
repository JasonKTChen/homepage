              Proposed, designed, and implemented a major refactor for the SLA
              Monitor that is already hard to maintain. Conducted experiments to
              discover potential overlooked edge cases that may cause unexpected
              behaviors. Communicated with internal clients to regather
              requirements and utilized findings to completely overhaul the
              internal logic. Created data models and cleaned up JDBC queries in
              favor of Hibernate and Spring Data JPA. Disentangled undocumented
              business logic and ambiguities. Reduced the amount of code. The
              execution time for a background process was reduced from 3 minutes
              to 0.25 seconds. The amount of time for developing a new SLA
              monitoring type was reduced from over 4 weeks to less than 2
              weeks. Further architectural changes are made possible.

              Designed and implemented an architecture evolution for the SLA
              Monitor. Decomposed and restructured the application running on
              EC2 into 3 components running on ECS and AWS Lambda to set the
              foundation for upcoming requirements of high availability and
              multi availability zone deployment.

            <li class="d-flex align-items-start mb-1">
              Self-learned TypeScript and Angular. Designed and built an Angular
              front-end for the Messaging Management Platform from scratch to
              replace the old UI. Improved usability and received positive
              feedback from internal users.
            </li>
            <li class="d-flex align-items-start mb-1">
              Designed and built a Python Lambda function that consumes a
              Kinesis Data Stream and saves records into a Postgres database.
              The Lambda replaces a piece of a monolithic Java application.
              Increased the throughput from 80 records / min to 90,000 records /
              min.

              Participated in the design and implementation of operationalizing
              the onboarding process for the SLA Monitor. Designed and
              implemented Lambda APIs to allow internal clients to self-service
              onboarding. Developers on our team saved 8 hours per week on
              average supporting clients' onboarding requests.

              Designed and implemented a performance test suite for the SLA
              Monitor and Messaging Management Platform. Conducted performance
              tests and identified bottlenecks to achieve optimal performance.
              Increased the throughput by 8 times and 14 times respectively.
